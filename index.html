							<h4 class="about-sub-heading">My name is Charan Kamal Singh.<h4>
							<h5>I am a Student and lives in Toronto, Canada.</h5>
							<p class="about-text">I am a native of jammu&Kashmir, which is the northern part of India. I came here to Canada in 2019, to attain my dreamâ€™s which is to get a better education and to be successful in my life, I completed my 12th in 2017 and decided to do higher studies, after doing research and studies about some colleges in India I decided to study in my home city, but the decision is not quite good as the education system in India is less effective and boring. So, after that I decide to do my higher studies abroad, So, I chose this program and the college to fulfill my dream as the Canadian education system is much effective and easier to learn. Talking about my hobbies, traveling is my first favorite thing as I am very keen to find a new place and to meet new people and to learn their culture, ethnicity, and life. Reading books is my other hobby as books are the treasure of knowledge and reading a book helps me to gain knowledge and spend my free time. </p>

				<h3 class="project-heading">Flipgrid Assignment Description</h3>
				This Flip Grid assignment challenges us to figure out where we stand and what we're thinking about in terms of life, the future, and our dream. This is a 90-second speech about our life and dream. Since speaking in front of a large group of people is challenging, this challenge boosts morale. However, this technology and the flip grid assignment provide us with a new space that is beyond our classroom.Since we use a camera in our everyday lives, this new challenge is really creative for me. The flip grid assignment introduces us to a new world outside of our classrooms. This assignment has given me confidence and improved my speaking abilities.

			</br></br><h4>Knowledge:</h4> This flip grid assignment has improved my understanding of a new media medium called flip grid video.</br></br>
				
				<h4>Confidence:</h4> This assignment gives me the confidence to say whatever I want, and it also teaches me how to develop my basic communication skills while talking to or listening to others.

				
			</div>
			
			<div class="project-description" id="proj-desc-Ass2">
				<h3 class="project-heading">Self Assessment</h3>
					Self Assessment assignment was really helpful and following were the couple of questions which were asked in that self assessment.</br>
					1. Introduce yourself (Tell me a little bit about yourself, your academic background etc.)</br>
					2. Why did you choose this area/program of study?</br>
					3. What will a potential employer find attractive about your current or past accomplishments and/or education?</br>
					4. List your top 5 marketable skills, related to your area of study and give at least one example of how you have put each of them to practice. (You can include your transferable skills and technical skills.)</br>
					<p>One of the best answer that I have gven and I liked was</p>
					<p>Growing up I was an average student with medium grades but after my seventh standard I started playing sports and I was one of the players in our schoolâ€™s basketball team. Being in the basketball I learned how to be in a team player and co-ordinate with people. I think that is one of trait that an employer will be attracted. Because in this corporate world that I am going to join it is really important to be with people and understand the what your team members want and act accordingly. Also, one more quality I have that am employer will be attracted to is I am responsible to the work that I take up. If I start any work, I will make sure that I complete it and I will take the responsibility till that work is completed.</p>

					<p>Overall it was a great experience to self assess and know overselves at what point we are in and what are the things that we need to improve.</p>

				<h5>Reason for picking this job:</h5>
				<p>Growing up I was always interested in construction and how the houses were built. I used to go to construction sites and observe how the machines are being used and fascinated me and I knew one day I am going to start a business related to construction. That is the reason I joined this program to learn how a business needs to run. And the reason that I chose this company is that it is there in the market from 1947 which is like 70 years and successfully running and growing. That is something I look for in an organisation. This role is apt for me as it is a junior management role and also, I can learn how the management is done in construction business.</p>
